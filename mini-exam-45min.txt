1.	install httpd and configure it to run on port 82
2.	create user lori with UID 1100 and set her shell to /sbin/nologin
3.	find all files in the /etc directory that have lines starting with either "Administrator" or "administrator" (but no caps on other positions) and write a list of the absolute filenames to /tmp/stratorfiles.txt
4.	create a symbolic link with the name /tmp/hosts, pointing to /etc/hosts
5.	create a group sales, and a shared group directory /data/sales. Ensure that all new files in this directory are group-owned by the group sales. Make users linda and lisa member of the group sales and ensure that all users can only delete their own files. User linda should be able to delete all files. 
6.	create an LVM volume with the name lvlab and a size of 50 extents. If necessary, grow an existing volume group to do so, or add a new storage device to you system to create the volume group. Format the volume with the XFS filesystem and mount it persistently on the directory /lvlab. Ensure that no executable files can be started from this volume. If you succeed in making the persistent mount without using /etc/fstab, you will get 10 bonus points. 
7.	set the recommended tuned profile for your system 
8.	write a list of all files that have either the SUID or SGID permission set to /root/sugidfiles.txt
9.	write a script /root/sugidcheck that executes every day at 1AM, using cron. Run this as a user cron job for user root. The script should generate a list of all files that have either the SUID and SGID permissions set. It should next compare this list with the content of the files in /root/sugidfiles.txt. If new files were found, the script should write a message to the system logging, with the text NEW SUID OR SGID FILES WERE FOUND. To test the working of the script, create the file /tmp/testfile and add the SUID permission to its default permissions.
